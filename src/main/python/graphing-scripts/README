Use these scripts to generate graphs of the output of the synthetic simulator.
Before you can do that, you have to run some simulations.

Once you have run some simulations, use CLUSTER_SIM_HOME/bin/generate-graphs.sh
to generate graphs based on the output those simulations generated, which
resides in HOME/experiment_results.
